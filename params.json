{"name":"Lumus","tagline":"SickBeard, CouchPotato and Headphones lightweight alternative for automated downloading movies, shows and music with torrents written in node.js.","body":"How to install on Raspbmc / Linux\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFirst we need to install a torrent downloader called [transmission](http://www.transmissionbt.com/). Skip this step if you already have transmission configured.\r\n\r\n### Transmission\r\n\r\nWe only need to install a daemon (service running at background) instead of full-featured client. Thanks to that, less memory will be used.\r\n\r\n1. Install transmission  \r\n\t`$ sudo apt-get install transmission-daemon`\r\n\t\r\n2. Set it to run at startup  \r\n\t`$ sudo update-rc.d transmission-daemon defaults`\r\n\t\r\n3. Stop the deamon  \r\n\t`$ sudo /etc/init.d/transmission-daemon stop`\r\n\t\r\n4. Configure  \r\n\t`$ sudo nano /etc/transmission-daemon/settings.json`\r\n\t\r\n\tYou may also use `vi` if you prefer, or any other editor.  \r\n\t`$ sudo vi /etc/transmission-daemon/settings.json`\r\n\t\r\n\tYou should at least change these settings:\r\n\t* `download-dir` to some generic download directory such as ~/Downloads (lumus will move the files to destination directories from here),\r\n\t* `incomplete-dir` to some generic incomplete downloads directory such as ~/Downloading,\r\n\t* `incomplete-dir-enabled` to `true`,\r\n\t* `rpc-enabled` to `true`.\r\n\t\r\n### Node.js\r\nThis is a required step so that the application can run.\r\n\r\n`sudo apt-get install nodejs npm`  \r\nAnswer `Y` if asked.\r\n\r\n### Lumus\r\n\r\n1. Clone lumus sources  \r\n`git clone https://github.com/ziacik/lumus.git`\r\n\r\n2. Go to the lumus directory\r\n`cd lumus`\r\n\r\n3. Install dependencies  \r\n`npm install`\r\n\r\n4. Run  \r\n`node app.js`\r\n\r\n5. Browse to configure  \r\n[http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n-----\r\n\r\n* This howto is incomplete.\r\n* This project is a work in progress.\r\n* This tool does not download any content. It only provides a convenient search interface to transmission client.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
